<p>Brothers and sisters in Christ, these are exciting and glorious times. It is time for great expectations and also greater work. The United States of America is not going down! She is going up! For those “doom and gloom” prophets who prophesy against the United States and speak of its demise, they better not hold their breath, because it is not going to happen in this generation, not while you and I are still here!</p>

<p>Mike and I attended the annual KCM (Kenneth Copeland) ministers’ conference this January and Brother Copeland read a word sent by a couple in South Africa. They wrote as they were praying for the United States, they received this from the Lord; (although the words are not exact, the message is intact):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what the Lord says, “The nation of Israel was established because of My promise to Abraham and My love for the people. But the United States of America was established as a nation because of the people’s love for Me, and I will never forget it!” Alleluia!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="those-prophets-who-prophesy-doom-and-gloom-and-the-demise-of-this-country-do-not-have-the-heart-of-god-nor-a-love-for-god-s-people">Those prophets who prophesy doom and gloom and the demise of this country do not have the heart of God nor a love for God’s people.</h2>

<p>As a nation and as a person, it always grieves the heart of God when disaster falls upon His people because of wickedness because of His love, and He always leaves it to us, His people, to turn things around for good!</p>

<p>Let me quote you some Scripture that supports this and shows the heart of God, which is rich in mercy and abounding with love for His people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 18:7-10 (NIV) If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 23:28-32 (NIV) “Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. “Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? Therefore,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The LORD declares.’ Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the LORD. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Any prophecy that is based on fear is not from the Lord!</strong></p>

<p>Remember Y2K? How many of God’s people were led astray because of fear? The people of God cowered in fear, started hoarding food and other supplies, and some even fled to remote places which is rebellion (witchcraft) to what the Lord Jesus commanded us: To occupy until He comes (Luke 19:13). “Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matt 28:18-20).</p>

<p><strong>Any program and any prophecy that turns the people of God and from obeying this great commission from the Lord is not from the Lord Jesus Christ!</strong> Do not remove your focus from our Lord Jesus Christ and His command, His faithfulness and His goodness!</p>

<h2 id="don-t-allow-fear-to-keep-you-from-your-calling">Don&rsquo;t allow fear to keep you from your calling</h2>

<p>What fear mongering is stopping you from obeying the great commission today? Is it the rampant prophecy about the U.S. coming economic collapse? Is it the destruction of Israel? Is it the appearance of the anti-Christ? What is it? Allow me to address the above scenarios and let me put it bluntly: They are all based upon fear, they do not line up with the word of God, and they are all false!</p>

<p><strong>Let’s look at God’s word on this issue:</strong>
&gt; 1 John 4:18 “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 1:7 “For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.”
If people believe that the United States economy is going to collapse, then for them and their family, it is going to collapse. But we and millions of believers here in the U.S. that stand on the word of God, know and are aware that the source of our increase is not based upon the economy of the world. Rather our faithfulness and obedience to the Lord results in our increase and blessing from the economy of God. There will always be a Land of Goshen for God’s faithful people. Do not repeat any prophecy of doom and gloom or you will subject yourself and your loved ones to partake of it. Instead, get down on your knees and ask God for direction. It may be an economic collapse for the wicked of the world, but we see it as the fulfillment of God’s word: the wealth of wicked is laid up for the righteous (Proverbs 13:22, Ecclesiastes 2:26). This is a great opportunity for the transfer of wealth! Which scenario would you choose for you, your family, and for this nation?
The destruction of the nation of Israel. Have you not known nor heard? “He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”</p>

<p>Psalm 121:3-4 (KJV). God promised Abraham, and God remains faithful, that He would bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel (Genesis 12:3). Period! Do you not know the faithfulness and the love of our God? If I were you, I would not be concerned about Iran’s nuclear power and its plot to destroy the nation of Israel; it is not going to happen because it is not in the Book. The Bride of Christ is here and that is you and I. God will never judge the wicked with His right righteous ones (Psalm 91, Malachi 3:16-18). Besides, He will not allow Satan to win!
What about the oil shortage? What about it? There is no oil shortage! God is dealing with our government so that we will be independent from foreign oil! We have more than enough oil deposits in this country to last until the Lord comes and beyond. God is perfect love (1 John 4:16); He does not have the ability to miscalculate what we need while on earth and we will be here for eternity. We will only be gone for seven years! When the Lord’s administration will come in full power on earth, He will not be facing an energy crisis and for that matter, any crisis. He is God, and you and I belong to Him. Make sure that He knows you (Matt 7:15-23)!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-what-about-the-anti-christ-and-the-mark-of-the-beast">But what about the Anti-Christ and the mark of the beast?</h2>

<p>What about it? According to 1 John 2:18-19, many anti-christs have come. Do not spend any more of your time and money trying to identify who the anti-christ is. By doing so, you are moving your focus away from the Lord Jesus and His goodness, and are being distracted by false teachings. Beloved, let us not touch anymore of these teachings that lead God’s people to cower in fear so that they will not prosper. Let us pray that the conviction of the Holy Spirit will come upon them that they might change course! If you say, “well Pastor Cris, these people are known prophets and they have big ministries and you are totally unknown.” It is true that I am unknown but I guarantee you that Jesus knows me and I know Him! This is more important than anything and anyone else in the whole world! “Why are you boasting?” I am merely following the Word of the Lord in Jeremiah 9:24 which says, “but let him who boasts boast about this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,’ declares the Lord.” Any teaching that moves us away from the focus and testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ is a false prophecy from a false prophet. Do not receive it! As stated in the book of Revelation 19:10 - “…for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” This is our litmus test: does the message or sermon reveal Christ and reconcile me to God through His Son Jesus?</p>

<p>A few years ago, I asked a sister in Christ to get me a book about the anti-Christ. The author of this book claimed that he spent many years researching to write this book. I read a few chapters and then I apologized to the Lord on behalf of this brother and for all of us who allowed ourselves to be deceived and to give in to fear instead of preaching the Good News. In reading this book, nobody got saved, healed or delivered. <strong>It removed the focus from the goodness of the Lord and focused on the power of Satan</strong> (which he has none because all authority was given to Jesus and He delegated that authority to His Body). Countless numbers of books are now being sold that focus on “doom and gloom”. Beginning in year 2011, God is going to hold these people accountable because their books do not benefit and even ensnare His people. Let us not teach this false doctrine of end-times eschatology, Body of Christ. We have lots to do for the Lord! He is still sitting on His throne waiting for his enemies to be made His footstool. We will experience greater anointing starting this year and the Lord Jesus will answer by fire! We should not be surprised that there are more prophets predicting “doom and gloom” in comparison to those that are focusing on the Lord Jesus, prophesying hope, blessings, and second chances. Even in Elijah’s time, there were 450 false prophets for every one of God’s prophets. One anointed prophet of God is more than enough to come against 450 or even thousands of false prophets. And because God’s power was with him, he was able to reconcile an entire nation back to God with signs and wonders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 1:10 - See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us join ranks with God’s faithful people and let us be counted as the faithful ones with clean hands and pure hearts! Even so, come Lord Jesus!</p>
