<p>Dear Partners and Friends,</p>

<p>Four years ago, the Lord spoke prophetically and said; “If My people will unite, this nation can have the most righteous leaders and government she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.” You may say, is that possible?  Is anything impossible for God?  No!  But for this to happen, we must meet the criteria and unite, and the only way we can unite politically, is to unite around truth found in God’s Word.</p>

<h2 id="as-christians-we-have-come-to-understand-that-we-must">As Christians we have come to understand that we must:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Vote as a Christian first, then as an American, then other issues.</p></li>

<li><p>Vote pro-life.</p></li>

<li><p>Vote for the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman.</p></li>

<li><p>Vote in support of Israel.</p></li>

<li><p>Not make economy the main issue, because our blessing is from honoring and obeying God.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But if more than one candidate embraces all these principles, is there a more concise way for believers to choosing our leaders? Is God’s Word any clearer? Yes!!!! God’s Word gives even more specific guidelines for us to follow when choosing leaders in government.  &ldquo;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge…&rdquo; Hosea 4:6. We know to look in God’s Word for guidance in every other situation of life so to start, let’s look at guidelines God gave Israel when choosing a king to rule over them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Deuteronomy 17:14-20 NIV] –</p>

<p>[14] When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, &ldquo;Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,&rdquo; [15] be sure to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother Israelite. [16] The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, &ldquo;You are not to go back that way again.&rdquo; [17] He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. [18] When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the priests, who are Levites. [19] It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees [20] and not consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the first item underlined in verse 15 “be sure to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses!” We have to ask the Lord who He has chosen!  This is not for believers to decide themselves.  Proverbs 3:5-6 KJV says: &ldquo;[5] Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. [6] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&rdquo; We have to ask God His choice and let Him guide us!!!</p>

<p>We see an example of this when God sent Samuel to the house of Jesse to anoint a king to replace Saul after he had sinned against the Lord. The Lord told Samuel in 1 Sam 16:1 KJV “…I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.” Notice God already made His choice, and was going to let Samuel know after he went to the house of Jessie in Bethlehem. 1 Sam 16:3 KJV “…call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me [him] whom I name unto thee.”</p>

<p>So Samuel went to Bethlehem and in 1Sam 16:5-7KJV  &ldquo;[5] … he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.” Notice too that after arriving in Bethlehem Samuel would have made a big mistake if he had leaned on his understanding, because the Bible says he looked on Eliab and thought because of his stature and appearance, that he was the one.  But God said in VS 7 “…the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.&rdquo; This is key!!! God told Samuel, don’t be deceived by appearance.  Look beyond what they say, what they look like, their speaking, debate, or management skills. We have to see as the Lord sees, from the heart, and this can only be done through consultation with the Holy Spirit.  Ask God to open your eyes to see the one the Lord favors!!!</p>

<p>Jesse brought all his sons to the banquet except his youngest son David who was left to tend the sheep.  In the mind of Jesse, David didn’t qualify.  Let us not make this same mistake and allow anyone to be disqualified because others say they don’t qualify!!!  Too often we look at outward appearances, but God looks deeper.  He looks at the heart.  He looks for the one who will listens to His voice and who looks to God for guidance in every area of life.  This one characteristic alone is the most important to look for in a leader and will preserve us.  In God We Trust!  We must return to the place where our leaders are men and women that seek after God’s heart.</p>

<p>Ask God, which contender holds these characteristics.  Then look again at Deut 17, and we can find additional characteristics of a leader after God’s heart.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first we know, Vs. 15…“be sure to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses”</p></li>

<li><p>Next Vs. 15 says “He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother Israelite.” HE HAS TO BE A BELIEVER!!! A brother in Christ and believer in the God of the Bible, and not just in word only!!!   Jesus said, in Mt 7:6  “Ye shall know them by their fruits”.</p></li>

<li><p>Vs. 16 says:” ..must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself.” He cannot be one that see’s the office as a place to gain personal wealth, power, or influence.  You may again say, there seem to be more than one that fit that description.  Then keep reading.</p></li>

<li><p>Vs. 17. says: “He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray” Is he faithful in relationships?</p></li>

<li><p>And Vs. 17. says: “…He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. Again, they cannot be looking to enrich themselves but rather to serve the people as unto the Lord.</p></li>

<li><p>And Vs. 18. “When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the priests, who are Levites. [19] It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees. Does this individual look to the Word of God for guidance and strength, and do they spend time in real prayer looking to God and His Word for direction?</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, Deuteronomy 17:20, says this individual is “not to consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left.” The race and position cannot be about him!  Do they have humble heart that considers others better than himself, of true service for the people and nation? Do they look to the Word of God for guidance and direction and have a heart of service for the people?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the Body of Christ will unite on criteria spelled out in the Word of God, not lean on their own understanding, and vote for righteousness by choosing the one the Lord chooses, then “… this nation can have the most righteous leaders and government she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.” UNITE!!!</p>

er, God will also make it clear to you. Notice too that after arriving in Bethlehem Samuel would have made a big mistake if he had leaned on his own understanding, because the Bible says he looked on Eliab and thought because of his stature and appearance, that he was the one. However God told Samuel “… Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.&rdquo; (I Samuel 16:7 KJV)</p>

<p>This is key!!! Don’t be deceived by outward appearances, fame or popularity. Look beyond these through prayer and consultation with the Holy Spirit to see as the Lord sees. Also in the mind of Jesse, David’s father, David didn’t qualify and so Jesse didn’t even invite his youngest son to the banquet, but left him to tend the sheep. David was being a good steward of his father’s flocks and ministering to the Lord which in God’s eyes qualified him for selection. God wants one who will listen to His voice and look to Him for guidance in every area of life no matter what position they are in. David was faithful in this and this one characteristic is probably the most important to look for in choosing leaders to take an active role in government.  We must go back to choosing leaders that have a track record of seeking and relying on God for direction in every area and decision. Then we will again be a people whose God is the Lord and will live again by the motto imprinted on our treasury bills, “In God We Trust!”</p>

<p>If the Body of Christ will follow the steps outlined above and unite on clear principles found in the Word of God, “… this nation can have and will have the most righteous leaders and most righteous government that she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.”</p>

<p>LET THE CHURCH UNITE!!!</p>

<p>! He is still sitting on His throne waiting for his enemies to be made His footstool. We will experience greater anointing starting this year and the Lord Jesus will answer by fire! We should not be surprised that there are more prophets predicting “doom and gloom” in comparison to those that are focusing on the Lord Jesus, prophesying hope, blessings, and second chances. Even in Elijah’s time, there were 450 false prophets for every one of God’s prophets. One anointed prophet of God is more than enough to come against 450 or even thousands of false prophets. And because God’s power was with him, he was able to reconcile an entire nation back to God with signs and wonders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 1:10 - See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us join ranks with God’s faithful people and let us be counted as the faithful ones with clean hands and pure hearts! Even so, come Lord Jesus!</p>

<p>the face of the earth.) 4 At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you.’ So the three of them came out. 5 Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward, 6 he said, “Listen to my words: “When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams. 7 But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. 8 With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” 9 The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them. 10 When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam—leprous, like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy; 11 and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed. 12 Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.” 13 So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!”</p>

Is this the time to take money, or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or menservants and maidservants? 27 Naaman’s leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” Then Gehazi went from Elisha’s Presence and he was leprous as white as snow.</p></li>

<li><p>Daniel 6:3-5 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5 Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has Something to do with the law of his God.”</p></li>

Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the Spirit, “In the name of Jesus Chirst I command you to come out of her!” At moment the spirit left her. 12. Words are few — only speaks the word of God. Usually prophets are loners, seldom socialize. They are completely set apart for God</p></li>

<li><p>Proverbs 10:19 When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise.</p></li>

<li><p>Luke 10:27 He answered: &ldquo; &lsquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;Love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Matthew 6:31-34 So do not worry, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear?&rsquo; 32For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p></li>

<li><p>Romans 14:17-18 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 18because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.</p></li>

Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears. 17 Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover the lower part of your face or eat the customary food of mourners.” 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.</p></li>

<li><p>Jeremiah 16:1-4 Then the word of the Lord came to me: 2 “You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” 3 For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who ar their mothers and the men who are their fathers: 4 “They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of th air and the beasts of the earth:”</p></li>

<li><p>John 16:13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.</p></li>

<li><p>1 John 4:13-21
We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. 16And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.17In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. 18There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
19We love because he first loved us. 20If anyone says, &ldquo;I love God,&rdquo; yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.</p></li>

<li><p>John 15:1-17
&ldquo;I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 2He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. 3You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 4Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
5&rdquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.6If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. 8This is to my Father&rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
9&rdquo;As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 10If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father&rsquo;s commands and remain in his love.11I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. 12My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. 13Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 14You are my friends if you do what I command.15I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master&rsquo;s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. 17This is my command: Love each other.</p></li>

<li><p>Joshua 1:13-18
“Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you: ‘The Lord your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.’ 14 Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers. 15 until the Lord gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.” 16 Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 17 Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses. 18 Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”</p></li>

<li><p>Nehemiah 8:10 Nehemiah said, &ldquo;Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&rdquo;</p></li>

<h2 id="18-prophets-fight-for-others-but-they-do-not-defend-themselves-they-let-god-defend-them-instead">18. Prophets fight for others but they do not defend themselves. They let God defend them instead</h2>

Prophets have a kingly mindset, great boldness, strong, and a  completely confident focus on the Lord Jesus and His word. They only let God change the instructions.</h2>

<p>Some people might say, “You have a big head.” As a prophet, it’s true! Christ Jesus is your Head! He is going to say fantastic things through you; God is faithful. They will surely happen if you obey Him. Some might also say, “You’ve lost your mind…” They are right! You have lost your own mind and now have the mind of Christ.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 Corinthians 2:15-16
15The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man&rsquo;s judgment: 16&rdquo;For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?&rdquo; But we have the mind of Christ.</p></li>

<li><p>Ephesians 4:14-16 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.15Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. 16From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 11:3</strong>
&ldquo;But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent&rsquo;s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Philippians 4:6-8</strong>
&ldquo;6Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
8Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>1 Peter 1:13-16
13Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 14As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. 15But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 16for it is written: &ldquo;Be holy, because I am holy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>2 Corinthians 10:5
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
We have a perfect example and warning to never change the instructions from the Lord until He changes them Himself; consider the young prophet from Judah who was killed for it. (next page)-&gt;</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I Kings 13:11-18
11 Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king. 12 Their father asked them, &ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo; And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken. 13 So he said to his sons, &ldquo;Saddle the donkey for me.&rdquo; And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it 14 and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree…
The man of God was found at a point of idleness, sitting down, possibly hungry and thirsty, perhaps even losing focus, letting his mind wander away from passionately following the instructions of the Lord. The motive of our strong resolve must be because of sold-out love for God, and His love through us for others. We must continue moving in love, never sitting idle to be self-indulgent.</p>

<p>…and asked, &ldquo;Are you the man of God who came from Judah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>15 So the prophet said to him, &ldquo;Come home with me and eat.&rdquo;
16 The man of God said, &ldquo;I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 17 I have been told by the word of the LORD : &lsquo;You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.&rsquo; &ldquo;
18 The old prophet answered, &ldquo;I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD : &lsquo;Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.&rsquo; &ldquo; (But he was lying to him.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The man of God did not test the spirit of what he heard (1 John 4). He let his mind loose to consider something outside of the word of the Lord. He took his focus off of God, seeking someone else as the source of instruction, and seeking something else as the source of fulfillment and satisfaction (food, drink, comfort).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I Kings 18:19-20
19 So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.</p>

<p>20 While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back. 21 He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, &ldquo;This is what the LORD says: &lsquo;You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you. 22 You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>23 When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. 24 As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>1 John 4
On Denying the Incarnation [and testing the spirits]
&ldquo;1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.
4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.&rdquo;</li>
