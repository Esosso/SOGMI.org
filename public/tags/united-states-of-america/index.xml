        <description>The following is an excerpt from the December 31, 2013 Prophetic Conference:
Prophecy for 2014  We are entering a new season, a season like no other. Great harvest of souls in every area of our lives. Harvest for the Body of Christ will be exponential and in accelerated pace/time. The revival in United States as a country will start in the political arena, then in the financial, educational arena.</description>

        <description>Dear Partners and Friends,
Four years ago, the Lord spoke prophetically and said; “If My people will unite, this nation can have the most righteous leaders and government she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.” You may say, is that possible? Is anything impossible for God? No! But for this to happen, we must meet the criteria and unite, and the only way we can unite politically, is to unite around truth found in God’s Word.</description>

        <description>Brothers and sisters in Christ, these are exciting and glorious times. It is time for great expectations and also greater work. The United States of America is not going down! She is going up! For those “doom and gloom” prophets who prophesy against the United States and speak of its demise, they better not hold their breath, because it is not going to happen in this generation, not while you and I are still here!</description>

        <description>I cannot put into words the awesome wonders of our Lord Jesus Christ! All I can say is that it is great to be alive (in Christ). Right before our eyes, we see the transformation of our nation and this is just the beginning! What’s even more exciting than this is the fact the Lord always shares His plans, His thoughts, and His heart with the Body of Christ if we have ears to hear and eyes to see!</description>
