        <description>The fruits and signs that revival has come include:
True repentance brought on by the Holy Spirit; Jesus becomes not just Savior, but Lord over every area. Focus on the presence of God, knowing Him and His word. Falling in love with Jesus; not getting drunk on visions or gifts. A grateful heart of worship; God multiplies our faith by His word and faith works by love. We are delivered from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not striving about fear or emotions, but looking steadfastly upon Jesus, living by faith in Him that we may please God by Him in us.</description>
