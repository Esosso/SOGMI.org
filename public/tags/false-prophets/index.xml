        <description>Brothers and sisters in Christ, these are exciting and glorious times. It is time for great expectations and also greater work. The United States of America is not going down! She is going up! For those “doom and gloom” prophets who prophesy against the United States and speak of its demise, they better not hold their breath, because it is not going to happen in this generation, not while you and I are still here!</description>
