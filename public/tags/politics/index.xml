        <description>Eight years ago, the Lord spoke to us prophetically saying “If My people will unite, this nation can have and will have the most righteous leaders and government she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.” You may ask, “Is that possible?” but nothing is impossible with God! However for this to happen, we have to unite, and the only way we will ever unite politically, is if we unite on the truth and principles found in God’s Word.</description>

        <description>Dear Partners and Friends,
Four years ago, the Lord spoke prophetically and said; “If My people will unite, this nation can have the most righteous leaders and government she has ever had since its inception, and even greater.” You may say, is that possible? Is anything impossible for God? No! But for this to happen, we must meet the criteria and unite, and the only way we can unite politically, is to unite around truth found in God’s Word.</description>

        <description>I cannot put into words the awesome wonders of our Lord Jesus Christ! All I can say is that it is great to be alive (in Christ). Right before our eyes, we see the transformation of our nation and this is just the beginning! What’s even more exciting than this is the fact the Lord always shares His plans, His thoughts, and His heart with the Body of Christ if we have ears to hear and eyes to see!</description>
