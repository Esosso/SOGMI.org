        <description>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.</description>

        <description>Brothers and sisters in Christ, these are exciting and glorious times. It is time for great expectations and also greater work. The United States of America is not going down! She is going up! For those “doom and gloom” prophets who prophesy against the United States and speak of its demise, they better not hold their breath, because it is not going to happen in this generation, not while you and I are still here!</description>

        <description>The following is a prophecy released back in 2010
We are entering a time when personal prophecy will become more and more rare. Continuing to hear the testimony of Jesus Christ, the prophetic mantle will address the Body increasingly on a corporate level instead of an individual level. Yes, remember the personal prophetic words that were released to you, but more important than that is the need for you to follow your prophetic instructions, concerning the Body of Christ and the Nations, to the letter.</description>

        <description>Real vs Counterfeit and Prophet Defined
A certain jewelry store sold man-made stones as though they were priceless, natural gems. This was happening for years and scores of men &amp;amp; women bought what they thought were precious stones. No one questioned the authenticity until someone with trained eyes pointed out they were man-made. How were people deceived? The counterfeit looked remarkably like the real. The difference was not noticeable unless you had a trained eye.</description>

The same thing that I did in the Philippines, with accreditation of signs and wonders in the realm of finances, saith the Lord, I will do now, if you are going to confer with Me, if you are going to put Me first, and if you are going to obey what you have learned and your instructions, saith the Lord, it will manifest starting this year.</description>
