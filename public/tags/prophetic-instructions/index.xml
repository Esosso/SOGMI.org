        <description>I cannot put into words the awesome wonders of our Lord Jesus Christ! All I can say is that it is great to be alive (in Christ). Right before our eyes, we see the transformation of our nation and this is just the beginning! Whatâ€™s even more exciting than this is the fact the Lord always shares His plans, His thoughts, and His heart with the Body of Christ if we have ears to hear and eyes to see!</description>
