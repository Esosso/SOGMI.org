        <description>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
 I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</description>

        <description>In 1991, I was caught in a dream-like vision. In this encounter with God, He handed me a formula on how to find His kingdom. It was a series of very detailed instructions He expected me to follow. He told me that He would be sending laborers who would follow my lead, knowing fully well that they would find the kingdom. These people were matured and did not desire material things.</description>
