Freedom Fellowship Church International (FFCI) was the first church to be born under the leadership of Sons of God Ministries International.

Led by Senior Pastor and SOGMI Co-Founder Pastor Cris, FFCI is SOGMI's home base stationed in San Antonio, TX. We are a non-denominational church that operates strongly in the prophetic and apostolic, but most of all we focus on spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ and building up His kingdom.
