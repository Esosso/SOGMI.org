description: "This is a season of many opportunities, a season of many open doors. Once these opportunities come, you must respond accordingly: You must follow the instruction, and you must follow God's ways of doing things. In other words, you need to be faithful because these opportunities will close. They are for a season, and this is the season of many opportunities. The Lord caused you and I and everyone in the Body of Christ, to be forced to confront the issues they are facing day to day that distract them from obeying God. It slows down the blessings. It may be a relationship, it may be family members, it may be a health issue, it may be financial or all of the above.\n\n- Revelation 22:11\n- Proverbs 4:16\n- Luke 6:45\n- Romans 12:21\n- Isaiah 45"
