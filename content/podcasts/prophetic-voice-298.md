description: Happy Thanksgiving to you! This message, we'll be revisiting a teaching from Pastor Cris about confronting the "Goliaths" in our life. When the entire nation of Israel fearfully focussed on Goliath, David fearlessly focussed on God and what God had revealed to him, quickly defeating the giant and saving the nation.
