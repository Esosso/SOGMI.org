description: "“The United States of America is not going to fall, not under our watch in Jesus’ name!... The Lord directed me a few weeks ago to go to Washington D.C. to pray for our country, political leaders, and to release prophecies... So we obeyed God… This is one thing about the Holy Spirit. He will not tell you the exact specific of why He’s sending you somewhere but He has your back. He will protect you, and you need to follow those instructions to the letter… and even if it’s not something great in your eyes, it’s very important to God that you put Him first and that you obey.” Key scripture: Isaiah 45:8"
