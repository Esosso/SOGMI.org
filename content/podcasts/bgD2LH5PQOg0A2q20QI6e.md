description: "You see what is before you. Those are the facts. But the facts cannot change the Truth. But the Truth, which is Jesus Christ, CAN change the facts for you. Then you'll be transformed into a new person and you'll end up transforming other people's lives by the way you live. If we focus on our weaknesses, then we will lack self-esteem. We'll be walking and living as a Christian by guilt. If we focus on the good things and our abilities, we will operate in pride. But if we focus on the love of God, then we are grateful, excited, and we share Him and His principles with others.\n\n- Philippians 4:4-8\n- 2 Corinthians 10:3-6\n- Romans 8:28\n- Luke 6:45\n- Romans 8:35-39\n- 1 Corinthians 2:16\n- Jude 1:20-21\n- Psalm 71:5\n- 2 Corinthians 3:5"
