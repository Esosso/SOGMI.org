description: "We need to hold fast to the covenant that God has kept with us, then we know that we will come out victorious. But in order to keep this covenant, we must be holy and blameless before God. We cannot touch wicked things, for then they will prosper. We must consecrate ourselves before Him, so that His covenant with us can be fulfilled."
