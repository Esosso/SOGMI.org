description: "God loves you and wants to talk to you! The scripture is very clear in Psalm 95:7-8 and Hebrews 3:7-8 \"Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\" You will hear from the mouths of many Christians who have been Christians for a long long time and even some leaders how the devil is talking to them, and they recognize the voice of the devil but they cannot hear or recognize the voice of God? So this the issue I must confront: why do you recognize the voice of Satan and you do not recognize the voice of God? Jesus said that those who belong to Him hear His voice and to the voice of a stranger they will not follow. John 10:1-5."
