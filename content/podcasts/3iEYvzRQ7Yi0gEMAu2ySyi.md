description: "We’re going to be talking about the life of David and how it applies to the time that we’re in right now. For the past several weeks at Freedom Fellowship, we’ve been talking about how God is setting up the church to be in a position to where we're going to subdue and overtake kingdoms in order to establish the kingdom of God. And when we refer to nations and kingdoms and establishing the kingdom of God in those nations and kingdoms, we don’t just mean into political nations but are also referring to how God is sending people in the body of Christ to the media industries, to the entertainment industries, to the technology industries etc. Those are also nations."
