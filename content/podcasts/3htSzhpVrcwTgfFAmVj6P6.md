description: "If you ever feel like you are not enough, remember that it is God who called you, it is His idea. For as long as God isn't panicking, we shouldn't panic either, but should rejoice for all that He has promised. We must stay vigilant and never act in fear. If it is out of fear it is outside of faith. We are in the season of harvest, so let us stay focused!"
