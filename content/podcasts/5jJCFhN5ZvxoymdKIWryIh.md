description: "The transfer of wealth and influence is not going to manifest when everyone else is in peace, but in war; we destroy the devil's work by implementing the kingdom's ways of doing things, by walking in the light. We know the end is victory, so we cannot get distracted by the darkness of the world. Let us focus on being the light."
