description: "You need to believe because you have nothing to lose by believing in our Lord Jesus Christ. And whether you think that you deserve it or you’re tired of suffering, just ask yourself, ‘have you fulfilled your purpose here on Earth?’ If you have not finished your race, then it is not the will of God that you’re suffering. It doesn’t matter whether it’s your fault. Doesn’t matter whether it’s the fault of others. Today is a new beginning for you, and today in the name of Jesus is the manifestations of your complete healing and deliverance."
