description: "Pastor Cris shares some of the highlights of what God did in the recent mission trip to the Philippines. “...in John 4:35, Jesus says ‘do you not say, four months more and then the harvest? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields. They are ripe for harvest.’ And I can truly say that in the Philippines… like in most countries or in all of the countries I have been so far that the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. And while in the Philippines, I also released the prophecy that I released over this radio: … a time is coming that we will see the manifestation of the rising and falling of many men and women in different sectors of society, whether in the political system, arts and entertainment, media, commerce, technology, and even in the church.”"
