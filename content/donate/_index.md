## Where Your Money Goes

Sons of God Ministries International (SOGMI) has held conferences and trainings all over the world. We focus on discipling the Body of Christ so they can become leaders in their areas of influence. We believe that if you can empower leaders you can transform a nation. As of now SOGMI has held conferences/trainings in The United States, Philippines, Japan, Pakistan, and The United Kingdom. We have also occassionally provided humanitarian aid after natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods.

Your donations will be used to pay for SOGMI's international trainings and conferences, online ministry, and radio ministry. By supporting us you help us create more content, and reach more people for Christ Jesus.

## Partner Benefits

Those who commit to donate monthly will be put on a shortlist for special events. We also will periodically send thank you gifts including teachings, t-shirts, accessories, and more.

In the future we will also start livestreaming special question and answer sessions where our monthly partners can submit questions that Pastors Mike and Cris can answer.
