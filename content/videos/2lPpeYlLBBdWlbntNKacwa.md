description: "The most valuable way we can spend our time is in the things God has placed before us. Pastor Josh Sosso encourages the Body of Christ to walk your calling in faith and realign your focus with the instructions God has given you. In this season, the way we spend our time is more valuable than previous seasons because we are in a time of acceleration. There's a good way and a 'best' way to spend our time. Learn God's ways of doing things!This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 06, 2020"
