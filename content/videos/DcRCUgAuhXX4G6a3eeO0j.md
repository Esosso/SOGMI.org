description: "Pastor Cris discusses how the majority of those in the Church rely on their own anointing instead of submitting to God and obeying Him. It's time to remove ourselves from the front and center. Our biggest priority is not establishing your position in the Kingdom of God, it is ministering before God and loving on Him. Make God your priority the blessings and the influence will come. During this sermon Pastor Cris also released numerous prophetic words to the nations including the United States, Philippines, South Korea, Russia, and China. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on March 27, 2022."
