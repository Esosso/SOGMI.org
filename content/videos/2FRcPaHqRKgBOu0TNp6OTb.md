description: "We had the privilege of Nicole sharing with us as she talked about the anatomy of a mustard seed and what it can accomplish. She put into prospective how tiny a mustard seed actually is and all the different uses one little seed can provide. She showed us that even with little faith, there is so much that can happen if we stretch our faith. We can continually stretch our faith by speaking the word of God over us and seeking out God. Look at your uncomfortable situations as a way to grow your faith even more!"
