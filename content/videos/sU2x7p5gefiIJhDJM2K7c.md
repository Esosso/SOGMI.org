description: "The service started with a surprise visit from Pastor Cris with personal words for people and instructions for the body of Christ. Then, Pastor Josh shared a message about maturity and how we have to grow. Like prophets in the Bible, they have to go through rigorous training and responsibility. We have to be discipled to take hold of the areas God has for us. Pastor Cris ends the service by giving us instructions to follow. This service was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
