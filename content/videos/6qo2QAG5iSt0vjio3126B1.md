description: "Pastor Josh uses parables from Luke 18 about being persistent and being humble. He urges us to not only be persistent in praying, but following the instructions given to us. He also discusses the rich young ruler who wouldn't give up his riches to enter the kingdom. While God doesn't want you to be poor, he is looking at your heart to see if you will give everything to him. God wants you to be successful so you can influence people around the world. \n"
