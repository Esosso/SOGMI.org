description: "Pastor Josh focused heavily on women in the church and how feminism started with the church years ago. He referenced 1 Timothy 2 with the rules Paul put on the church for that specific church to follow and how it was taken out of context. He also talks about how God created women in the book of Genesis, where God made them equal. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
