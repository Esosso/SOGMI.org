description: "If we repent for our disobedience and forgive those we harbor unforgiveness towards we will be restored. We must stop giving excuses, but instead take responsibility and come clean before God. Then supernatural and in many cases instantaneous restoration will begin to manifest in our life. This will lead to God's blessing manifesting in our life.\n\nSermon delivered by Pastor Cris at Freedom Fellowship Church at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
