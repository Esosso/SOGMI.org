description: "Happy Resurrection Sunday! Pastor Cris delivered a powerful message about letting the Lord lead us during battle. She mentions the story of Jehosaphat and how they followed the instructions from God that led to the defeating of their enemies without lifting a finger. We need to focus on the victory and celebrate for God intervening in the battle. Pastor Cris also discusses the breaking away of a negative and territorial mindset. Don't forget, this is a wonderful time to be alive! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
