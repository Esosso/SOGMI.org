description: "We are going to see God's mighty move this 2021. Let us stand on God's promises. He has allowed these things to happen so that the wicked root in Washington DC can be completely exposed and uprooted. This is an important season where me must continue to cover the nation in prayer, and also take inventory of our own lives and heart issues. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 30, 2020 with special words from Pastor Joshua Sosso."
