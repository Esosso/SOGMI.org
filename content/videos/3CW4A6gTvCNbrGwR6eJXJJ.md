description: "Tonight we are reminded that the assignments that God gave us were not gone just because we forgot them. Ed reminds us that when God opens an exit, he also opens a new door. Deborah shares with us that she continues to use the keys that God has given her, and encourages us to do the same. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
