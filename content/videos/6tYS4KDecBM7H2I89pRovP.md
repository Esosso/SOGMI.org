description: "Pastor Josh discusses the importance of following instructions to the letter. All of your promises can be met when you listen to God. Like in Exodus, God instructed Moses how to construct the Ark of the Covenant and other makings step by step. The same thing can happen for us if we spend time with God and seek him out. Our business plans from God need to be treated as sacred and we need to strive for detailed instructions from God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
