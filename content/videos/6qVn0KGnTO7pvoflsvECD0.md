description: "Most Christians pursue their own thing. They work on their own schedule rather than on God's schedule. However this is a season where if we don't focus on what God is saying we will miss it big time. God's destiny is bigger than what we imagine for ourselves. Let us submit to Him. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 2, 2021."
