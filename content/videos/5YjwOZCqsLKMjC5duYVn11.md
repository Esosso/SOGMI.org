description: "Pastor Josh focused heavily on the book of 1 Kings and the obedience of the woman that gave Elijah he last piece of bread. He talks about when the Lord gives you instructions, there will be other people of God that you cross paths with. He also talks about the woman with a jar of oil and how she gathered every jar she could find to pay off her debt. She wasn't shy about the word of the Lord and saw all her needs met. When we hear instructions from God, we need to stand firmly on them and no waver until they are complete.\n"
