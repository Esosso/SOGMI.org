description: "Will you put yourself in a position where God can use you? Pastor Josh discusses Isaiah 6 and how when Isaiah went into the presence of God, it was there that he received instructions directly from God. As leaders, we need to stop depending on others for breakthrough or relying on the anointing of others. We need to seek God out ourselves. Always focus on His Holy presence, because when we experience this, we can stand before nations or in uncomfortable situations and not be moved. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 25, 2020."
