description: "God has the final say and we have the victory! Pastor Mike compares the story of Jairus to our current time. In Luke 8, a messenger came from the official's house and told him, \"Your daughter has died, don't bother the Teacher any longer.” But Jesus heard it and said to Jairus, “Don't be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.” And Jairus' daughter was healed! In the same way, we are being told the election is already over, don't bother any longer. Only believe, it's not over yet!\n\nIt's Not Over is a sermon delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso on November 11, 2020 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
