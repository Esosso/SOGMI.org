description: "The prophetic words that the Lord has released over the United States have already begun to manifest. There are two systems at work in this nation. We must be vigilant to listen to and obey God. God wants to reestablish the covenant that was established in this nation at its founding. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso and Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 5, 2020."
