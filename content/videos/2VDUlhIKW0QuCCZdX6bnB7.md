description: "Pastor Cris announced the outside healing and praise service we will have in our parking lot. She shares the details of what we are doing and how we are to prepare for our first healing crusade. She mentions that in preparation for that weekend, we have to empty ourselves and learn everything from the Holy Spirit. There is so much that the Lord can do through us if we learn completely from the Holy Spirit. We could see our country turned if we empty ourselves."
