description: "Pastor Josh shared the revelation with us that we have to step into the unknown to get to the Promise Land. God took the Israelites through the wilderness so he could prove their faith and trust in him. Abraham's father started following towards the Lord, but never made it to the Promise Land. Abraham, however, was willing to go into the unknown and follow God through the uncomfortable. That is why God blessed Abraham for generations because he was willing to change his normal way of doing things. These 40 days and nights we are going through is a process to purify us and test our faith. God is seeing if we will follow him through the unknown and trust him. Since we have a big calling, we have to prove ourselves and that starts with these 40 days and nights."
