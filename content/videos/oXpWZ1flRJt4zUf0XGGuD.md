description: "Pastor Josh focused striving to see signs and wonders in our everyday lives. He tells us that our status quo should be signs and wonders and being someone with a good reputation. We as Christians, we should be the best workers in any area God puts us in. Like Joseph, he was a good steward in every part of his life, even in the worst times. Continue to focus on God, even in the darkest hours."
