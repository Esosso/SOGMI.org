## God is Preparing to Move Mightily

The Body of Christ is in a transitional period right now where God is preparing us for the greater move. We are being transitioned from good to God's best for us. Let us come together to here the Word of the Lord.

This conference is to help prepare us for the move of God. There will be ministry, prophetic Words spoken, and prophetic instructions given to us corporately and individually. So if you need to hear a Word from God then this is the event you need to be at.
