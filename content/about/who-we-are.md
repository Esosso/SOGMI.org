        Sons of God Ministries International (SOGMI) is a prophetic and apostolic ministry. We focus on discipling the Body of Christ and spreading the Gospel throughout the world. <br/>
        <br/>
        We aspire to transform leaders who will in turn transform nations and win the lost through the preaching of the Word with signs following. We train believers to walk as overcomers in every area of life, build up the Body of Christ to go forth in the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and prepare God's people for works of service until we all attain the full measure of the stature of Jesus Christ. <br/>
        <br/>      
        Ephesians 4:11-13, "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." (NIV)

    text: 
        Back in 2002 God revealed to Mike Sosso that the name of this ministry would be Sons of God Ministries International. But why is it called “Sons of God” and not something that might be seen as more inclusive like “Sons and Daughters of God”. The reason for this is when we are born again our identity is in Christ Jesus first. It says in Romans 8:14, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (NKJV) So even a woman who is led by the Holy Spirit can operate as and has the authority of a son of God. <br/>
        <br/>
        In Christ Jesus, we are not limited by our gender or even our race. We all have same power and authority in Christ Jesus our Lord. As it says in Galatians 3:28, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus." (NKJV)

  - heading: The Founders
    text: 
      Sons of God Ministries International was founded by Mike and Cristina Sosso in 2002. <br/>
      <br/>
      Mike Sosso is an ordained minister who’s been in the ministry for more than 35 years. In 1986, he was a founding member of the San Antonio chapter of Agape International, an apostolic and prophetic ministry that reached across denominational barriers to empower believers in the workings of the Holy Spirit. God later led him and Cristina to lay down their roles in Agape and found Sons of God International and Freedom Fellowship Church.<br/>
      <br/>
      Cristina is a former banker who was called by God in the apostolic and prophetic ministry in 1989. She served as the president of Agape International in the San Antonio chapter since 1990 until God called her and Mike to start Sons of God Ministries International.
