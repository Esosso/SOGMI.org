The following is a prophecy released back in 2010

We are entering a time when personal prophecy will become more and more rare. Continuing to hear the testimony of Jesus Christ, the prophetic mantle will address the Body increasingly on a corporate level instead of an individual level. Yes, remember the personal prophetic words that were released to you, but more important than that is the need for you to follow your prophetic instructions, concerning the Body of Christ and the Nations, to the letter. When you focus on ministering to Jesus' needs, He will lead you to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things (your personal prophecy's manifestations) will be added to you (Matt 6:33). That is why the prophecy to the Church and to the Nations is more important than your personal prophecy. Fix your eyes on Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of your faith. It will depend upon your desire for the heart of God, that He will be your complete source of all strength and love to follow the instructions for the Body, the Nations, and your personal life.

Hear what God is saying to the Body of Christ.
